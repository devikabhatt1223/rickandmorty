This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## About Project 

It is a sample project created with React which displays characters from a show called Rick and Morty. 
The actions you can perform are search, sort and filter amongst the characters displayed on the page. 
Using the toggle button on the top right corner you can hide and show filters from the left nav bar. 
The UI is web and mobile responsive and can work seemlessly on multiple devices and screen sizes.
